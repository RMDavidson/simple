<h1>Overview: Meal Planning and Grocery Shopping on a Low Fructose Diet</h1>
<p>This document assumes you have completed the elimination phase of the Low FODMAP diet, or otherwise narrowed down your trigger foods, and are looking for foods which fit within your individual tolerance level. Remember, everyone’s tolerance level is different. For some individuals, an ingredient may be tolerated when listed lower on the ingredient list, but not when it appears higher on the list where it makes up a higher percentage of the ingredients in that food.
</p>

<h2>Meal Planning</h2>
<p>
Meal planning can be beneficial when following a low fructose diet, particularly when first starting out. Start by finding a few of your favorite recipes, or pre-packaged foods, and looking at the ingredients. Modifying familiar recipes, rather than trying to make a new version, gives a sense of familiarity and comfort during the learning phase.
</p>

<h2>Trigger Foods</h2>

<p>
Some of the primary trigger foods, which are the hardest to avoid when following a low fructose diet, are High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), honey, onions, and garlic. For some individuals, sugar alcohols are also a trigger. Sugar alcohols can be identified by any ingredient name ending in -itol on a label.</p>

<p>Beware of the use of non-specific ingredients such as spices and natural flavors as these often contain onion or garlic.
</p>

<h2>Replacements for Common Trigger Foods</h2>

<p>The table below lists a few of the primary, or most commonly found and hard to avoid, trigger foods and some replacement suggestions for the flavors they provide in recipes.

Look for table sugar, pure cane   sugar, sugar, or other easily recognizable varieties.    |

<p>* NOTE: When selecting an infused oil, make sure that the bottle contains only the oils, and no pieces of onion, garlic, or other trigger foods commonly found in the dipping oil varieties. Infusing flavors only works with oils, the fructans contained in onion and garlic will leach into water and trigger a reaction as it would when used with other foods.</p>
<p>
** NOTE: Notice the spelling. Chili powder spelled with an -li at the end is often a blend of spices including onion and garlic. Chile powder spelled with an -le at the end is pure chile and does not contain any other ingredients.
</p>

<h2>Modifying Recipes</h2>
When modifying recipes to fit your needs, a few things need to be taken into consideration.
<ul>
<li>Fresh ingredients measure differently than dried.<br>
Ex: Use 3 Tablespoons of fresh basil, but only 3 teaspoons of dried basil.</li>
<li>Use the proper measuring cup. While it may not always matter, some baked foods can be finicky, and the rims of dry vs liquid measuring cups are slightly different.</li>
<li>	Measuring cups meant for liquid ingredients have a pour spout. </li>
<li>	Measuring cups meant for dry ingredients do not have a spout for easy leveling when measuring.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One cuisine frequently needing modification, due to its use of onion and garlic, is Mexican food. As an example, finding foods such as salsas that can be eaten without triggering symptoms can be difficult. The example recipe below will show you how to replace ingredients as needed.
